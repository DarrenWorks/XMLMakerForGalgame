# XMLMakerForGalgame
###Here is a new programer's production.

This program can make the XML files for making Galgame's dialogue ( the same as AVG game).

I'm still writing so this is not easy to use now but it will be.

Here is the rules to use it:

The single enter will just make a new line;

Two enter will be a new elements(The next sentence in game);

The "choice:" is the choice (button) in game, multi choices should split by ";" ;

The choice shall be the end of the XML,you should change the XML after that.
